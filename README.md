# Odin-Website
A Fanatastic project, found on the Odin Project website, to practice the fundamentals of CSS and HTML.
It is also a great way to develop the problem solving skill.

I would also like to give credits to Masashi Kishimo because my project is based on the characters found on his
show(anime) called Naruto.
